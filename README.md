<p> Upon loading the homepage, users will be presented with a display of information regarding the current weather in the first city listed in the search bar, that is displayed on the left side of the page. The information provided includes, on the right side of the page, an image representing the weather conditions, the current temperature, the current wind speeds, the current atmospheric pressure, and a forecast for the next 5 days containing the same information in the context of those days under all of the current information. In the search bar section, eight preset cities are listed under a search bar, with which users may enter a city of their choice to alter the city the page is displaying weather information for. At the bottom of the page are links to my GitHub profile, the repo for the application, my LinkedIn profile, and an option for users to contact me through email should they choose to do so.</p>
